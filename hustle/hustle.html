	<p> We needed to find the intersection of what our users needed and what we could accomplish. </p>
	<p>
	From our interviews with a group of people who already worked out regularly (found at the gym) and others who didn’t work out regularly but would like to, along with 2 rounds of surveys we released, we categorized our potential user problems into two camps:

	<p> Given that intrinsic motivation is a very difficult process to address, we focused on the more feasible challenge: targeting motivated people who need help executing.
 </p>
		<p> From our research, we concluded that there were three main things we wanted our app to do as well as how we were going to do it.  </p>

	<p> UX research and the power of heuristic evaluations. It doesn’t take 100 people to inform me that the flow of my app is awkward before I'm convinced that something I'm doing is confusing users. 2 or 3 people giving the same feedback is enough to have me iterating. </p>
