	<p> I tutored 2nd and 3rd graders in Oakland last fall. I noticed my students were constantly being taught that questions had one correct answer: in other words, convergent thinking. </p>

	<p> Convergent thinking is necessary and valuable. However, being trained in only one type of problem-solving may cause students to potentially lose the ability to think creatively and divergently. </p>

	<p id = "emphasis"> So how might we help elementary school students remain creative? </p>

	<div id = "rightside">
	<p> Before we defined the goal of our project, we sat in on classes, and interviewed elementary school teachers, parents, school administration, researchers in the field, and education professors at Berkeley. After listening to our stakeholders, we set to work. </p>

	<div id = "userneedstext">
	<p> Our interviews and observations led us to the insights revealing the daily challenges that both students and teachers face. </p>
	
	<p> Teachers need the time they lost doing administrative work to prepare effective curriculum, whereas students need a safe space where they felt valued. </p>
	<img id = "stickies" src = "./assets/stickies.jpg">
	<p> Students are less likely to be creative when they feel that their voices are not valued in the classroom. That's when they check out. So we asked the question:

	<div id = "thechallengetext"> 
	<p> At this point, our solution could still be anything. One of the greatest difficulties of this project was narrowing in to which aspect of a classroom we could help with our designs. </p>

	<p> It could be a new proposed layout of the classroom. It could be a daily warm-up exercise. It could be a tool to help reduce administrative work so that the teacher could have more time after school to prepare for their lessons. It could be a network online where teachers could share their curriculums and ideas with other teachers- creating a community of support for teachers. It could be a proposed restructuring of the daily routine. </p>

	<p id = "emphasis"> In short, we needed focus. </p>

	<p> What opportunities are available for us to make this difference? We created personas, journey maps, and organized our thoughts into 2x2 matrices as shown below. </p>

<div class = "box2">
<div id = "ideation">
	<div class = "subtitle"> 3. Ideation: Exploring different versions of the solution </div>
	<p> We brainstormed a list of activities we hypothesized would help enable students to think divergently. </p>
	<ul class = "losebullets" id = "spacing">
	<li>
	<a id = "listtitle"> Story Time </a> In groups of 4, each student writes down three words or phrases on three separate sheets of paper. The subjects range from “intergalactic spaceship,” “lawn,” or “Nick, the hero.” After putting all their words in the center, the students then need to work together to make a story out of all of the words. The activity is completed when they use all the words together. </li>
	<li> <a id = "listtitle"> Q&A </a>  The class collectively comes up with one “problem” that many people face. For example, “When I get new shoes, my feet have blisters.” Or as they’re learning to use the keyboard, “The keyboard is hard to use.” Then the students individually, or in a small team, has to write down 20 different ways to fix the problem within a short amount of time. </li>
	<li> <a id = "listtitle"> Reflectiive Journal </a>  Every week, there is some time set aside for the students to fill up one page with whatever they want to represent what they had learned the previous week. </li>
	<li> <a id = "listtitle"> You're the President! </a>  A longer project. Students imagine and build a country. This would include the country name, laws, culture, and geography. </li>
	<li> <a id = "listtitle"> The Principal </a>  Students imagine what it would be like to start from scratch and build a school. They draw out or build models of their ideal classrooms, explaining why they have chosen to make the decisions they do make. </li>
	<li> <a id = "listtitle"> Freaky Animals </a>  Name 2 different animals- and imagine what their babies would be like. </li>
	<li> <a id = "listtitle"> The Hat </a>  The students collectively come up with three “hats” for a speaker to wear. The “hats” will be types of people such as: genius computer science girl, or gym teacher, or Stephen Curry. One student volunteers to be up in front of the class, while the other students ask that student questions. For example, “What’s your best friend like?” or “What’s your favorite color and why?” After a period of time, the teacher will note “switch hats!” which requires the student to then start answering all the questions as a different person. </li>
	<li> <a id = "listtitle"> Professor? </a>  How do you explain x to someone who’s never seen one? Partnering up, students turn to each other- one acting as the “professor” and the other acting as the “student” who has never seen the subject. For example, “a dandelion” and the professor will attempt to explain to the student what the subject is. </li>
	<li> <a id = "listtitle"> The Alien </a>  What would you want to see if you had 1 day on his planet? And what would you show an alien who only had 1 day on your planet? </li>
	</ul>
	<p> Knowing that teachers operate on a tight schedule to hit all of the common core standards, we wanted an activity that could be most seamlessly and effortlessly be integrated with the teacher’s existing curriculum, so we proceeded with Snickerdoodle. </p>

		<li> How would this person respond in the following scenarios? And give students a scenario. For example: waiting at the coffee shop, someone accidentally spills coffee on this person. How does this person respond? </li>
		<li> What are some adjectives that might describe this person? Why? </li>
		<li> What does this person do in his/her free time? </li>

<div id = "usertesting">
	<div class = "subtitle"> 6. user testing: uncovering assumptions </div>
	<p> 
	When playing the game in two different classrooms, we encountered a few problems and assumptions that we had about the way the game would work and the way classroom interactions work. </p>

	<p> Assumptions uncovered: </p>
	<ul class = "losebullets" id = "spacing2"> 
	<li>
	2nd - 3rd grade students are generally quiet individuals who don’t have opportunities to speak up in class. </li>
	<li> Students are good listeners. They will retain what others say and build off of existing conversation. </li>
	<li> Students will avoid fixating on things already said and will come up with original ideas each time a new student speaks. </li>
	<li> Students will let other students speak and wait their turn before adding to the discussion. </li>
	<li> It is the student’s natural inclination to want to obey authority- and they need to learn how to challenge authority instead. </li>
	<li> The students will focus on the task at hand in group activities. </li>
	</ul>
	<p> In my 2nd – 3rd grade classroom, order, authority, and focus are a few of the most important things that students learn. Students normally just want to verbalize whatever is on their mind and do whatever they want when given the chance. I personally did not speak up in class in elementary school. But I was not the end-user. This class may have its own personality compared to other classes, but these characteristics made it difficult to play the game UNLESS the class was led by a strong teacher who was able to assert authority and moderate discussion. </p>
	<p> Observations: </p>
	<ul id = "spacing2">
	<li> Very chaotic game. </li>
	<li> Students got way too excited by the game, and it made them want to get out of their seats and start enacting different characteristic traits. </li>
	<li> Getting students excited but also focused is another issue. Though students say interesting things diverging off topic, creativity without structure or focus won’t be able to create anything. </li>
	</ul>
	<p> In future iterations, I would consider including a way to reward active listening and building discussion off of previous comments. I could also test penalizing any repeated comments. </p>
