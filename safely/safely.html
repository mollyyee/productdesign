	<p> There seemed to be two main tradeoffs between existing solutions: solutions that could help students physically get home safely, such as shuttles, campus walking partners, or even Ubers. These solutions were costly and could take up a lot of time in later hours. Other solutions that were crime notifier either had  confusing user interfaces or reported crime after the fact.
